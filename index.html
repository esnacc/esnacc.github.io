<h1>Enhanced Sample Neufeld ASN.1 C Compiler</h1>

<p class="lead">
    The Enhanced Sample Neufeld ASN.1 C Compiler is one of the oldest ASN.1
    compiler systems available. It is Free software (both Libre and Gratis),
    and can be used for all of your commercial or non-commercial projects.
</p>

<p class="lead">
    ASN.1 is a language used primarily to specify the form of messages to be
    transferred from one system to another. It spells out data types, order,
    optional elements, and many other things commonly used by message
    designers. ASN.1 compilers take these specifications and generate code
    in a target language (C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, etc.). The code
    usually includes methods for serializing and deserializing the messages
    using various encoding rules.
</p>

<p class="lead">
    eSNACC will take valid ASN.1, and generate C or C++ code to transfer
    ASN.1 messages in BER, and PER forms. It has been used in a wide array
    of open and closed source software packages.
</p>

<p class="lead">
    The code for eSNACC can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/esnacc/esnacc-ng/">eSNACC GitHub</a> pages.
    Simply run <code>git clone https://github.com/esnacc/esnacc-ng</code> and
    view the readme, install, and examples to get started.
